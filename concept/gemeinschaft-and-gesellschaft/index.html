<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p><em>Gemeinschaft</em> and <em>Gesellschaft</em> are German words that mean community and society respectively. Introduced in classical social theory, they are used to discuss the different kinds of social ties that exist in small, rural, traditional societies versus large-scale, modern, industrial ones.</p>
<h4 id="gemeinschaft-and-gesellschaft-in-sociology"><em>Gemeinschaft</em> and <em>Gesellschaft</em> in Sociology</h4>
<p>Early German sociologist <a href="https://blog.endr.in/people/ferdinand-tonnies/"><em>Ferdinand Tönnies</em></a> introduced the concepts of <em>Gemeinschaft</em> (Gay-mine-shaft) and <em>Gesellschaft</em> (Gay-zel-shaft) in his 1887 book <em>Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft</em>. Tönnies presented these as analytic concepts which he found useful for studying the differences between the kinds of rural, peasant societies that were being replaced across Europe by modern, industrial ones. Following this, <a href="https://blog.endr.in/people/max-weber/">Max Weber</a> further developed these concepts as ideal types in his book Economy and Society (1921) and in his essay &ldquo;Class, Status, and Party.&rdquo; For Weber, they were useful as ideal types for tracking and studying the changes in societies, social structure, and social order over time.</p>
<p>A sense of common identity, shared beliefs, close personal relationships, and an attachment to traditional and sentimental concerns are the major characteristics of gemeinschaft. In contrast, impersonal relations, formal organization, the absence of generally held or binding norms, and a detachment from traditional and sentimental concerns are the main characteristics of Gesellschaft. Gemeinschaft is common in rural, small-scale, homogenous societies, while gesellschaft is common in large-scale, industrial, and cosmopolitan societies. Gemeinschaft achieves its equilibrium through morals, social control, and conformism, while gesellschaft achieves its equilibrium through laws, police, tribunals and prisons. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://pediaa.com/what-is-the-difference-between-gemeinschaft-and-gesellschaft/">Source</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h4 id="the-personal-and-moral-nature-of-social-ties-within-a-gemeinschaft">The Personal and Moral Nature of Social Ties Within a Gemeinschaft</h4>
<p>According to Tönnies, <em>Gemeinschaft</em>, or community, is comprised of personal social ties and in-person interactions that are defined by traditional social rules and result in an overall cooperative social organization. The values and beliefs common to a <em>​Gemeinschaft</em> are organized around appreciation for personal ties, and because of this, social interactions are personal in nature. Tönnies believed that these kinds of interactions and social ties were driven by emotions and sentiments (Wesenwille), by a sense of moral obligation to others, and were common to rural, peasant, small-scale, homogenous societies. When Weber wrote about these terms in Economy and Society, he suggested that a <em>Gemeinschaft</em> is produced by the &ldquo;subjective feeling&rdquo; that is tied to affect and tradition.</p>
<p>Gemeinschaft, which is often translated as “community,” refers to a group of individuals mainly characterized by a strong sense of common identity, attachment to traditional and sentimental concerns, and close personal relationships. Moreover, individuals within a gemeinschaft are bound together by shared beliefs and shared physical space. Tönnies stated that personal social ties and personal interactions in gemeinschaft have base on traditional social norms and result in a cooperative social organization. Feelings of togetherness and mutual bonds are at the base of such groupings. Tönnies described emotions and sentiments, as well as a sense of moral obligation to others, drive these interactions and social ties. Furthermore, the concept of gemeinschaft was common in rural, small-scale, homogenous societies. Amish and Hassidic communities are two examples of Gemeinschaft. In gemeinschaft, rules are implicit (no written laws), and it’s factors like morals, social control, and conformism that achieve equilibrium. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://pediaa.com/what-is-the-difference-between-gemeinschaft-and-gesellschaft/">Source</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h4 id="the-rational-and-efficient-nature-of-social-ties-within-a-gesellschaft">The Rational and Efficient Nature of Social Ties Within a Gesellschaft</h4>
<p>On the other hand, <em>Gesellschaft</em>, or society, is comprised of impersonal and indirect social ties and interactions that are not necessarily carried out face-to-face (they can be carried out via telegram, telephone, in written form, through a chain of command, etc.). The ties and interactions that characterize a <em>Gesellschaft</em> are guided by formal values and beliefs that are directed by rationality and efficiency, as well as by economic, political, and self-interests. While social interaction is guided by Wesenwille, or seemingly naturally occurring emotions in a Gemeinschaft, in a <em>Gesellschaft</em>, Kürwille, or rational will, guides it.</p>
<p>This kind of social organization is common to large-scale, modern, industrial, and cosmopolitan societies that are structured around large organizations of government and private enterprise, both of which often take the form of bureaucracies. Organizations and the social order as a whole are organized by a complex division of labor, roles, and tasks.</p>
<p>As Weber explained, such a form of social order is the result of &ldquo;rational agreement by mutual consent,&rdquo; meaning members of society agree to participate and abide the given rules, norms, and practices because rationality tells them that they benefit by doing so. Tönnies observed that the traditional bonds of family, kinship, and religion that provide the basis for social ties, values, and interactions in a Gemeinschaft are displaced by scientific rationality and self-interest in a <em>Gesellschaft</em>. While social relations are cooperative in a Gemeinschaft it is more common to find competition in a <em>Gesellschaft</em>.</p>
<p>Gesellschaft, which is often translated as a society, is a grouping with individuals having impersonal and indirect social ties and interactions. However, these interactions are not necessarily face-to-face interactions; they can take place via telephone, in written form, through a chain of command, etc. More importantly, formal values and beliefs drive these ties and interactions. Furthermore, rationality, efficiency, economic and political interests and self-interests are key factors in Gesellschaft. According to Tönnies, in a Gesellschaft, scientific rationality and self-interest replace the traditional bonds of kinship, family, and religion, which are the basis for social ties, values, and interactions in a gemeinschaft. Furthermore, the concept of Gesellschaft is common in large-scale, industrial, and cosmopolitan societies. Such societies are generally structured around large organizations of government and private companies. Moreover, social order and organizations are organized by a complex division of labour and roles. In addition to these, Gesellschaft has explicit rules (written laws) and achieves its equilibrium through laws, police, tribunals and prisons. The members of society agree to abide by the rules, norms, and practices due to rationality, i.e., abiding by these rules provide benefits to them. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://pediaa.com/what-is-the-difference-between-gemeinschaft-and-gesellschaft/">Source</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h4 id="gemeinschaft-and-gesellschaft-in-modern-times">Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft in Modern Times</h4>
<p>While it is true that one can observe distinctly different types of social organizations prior to and after the industrial age, and when comparing rural versus urban environments, it&rsquo;s important to recognize that <em>Gemeinschaft</em> and <em>Gesellschaft</em> are ideal types. This means that though they are useful conceptual tools for seeing and understanding how society works, they are rarely if ever observed exactly as they are defined, nor are they mutually exclusive. Instead, when you look at the social world around you, you are likely to see both forms of social order present. You may find that you are part of communities in which social ties and social interaction are guided by a sense of traditional and moral responsibility while simultaneously living within a complex, post-industrial society.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-the-difference-between-gemeinschaft-and-gesellschaft">What is the Difference Between Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft</h4>
<p><img src="/assets/study/concept/difference-between-gemeinschaft-and-gesellschaft-comparison-summary.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The main difference between Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft is that Gemeinschaft is characterized by a strong sense of common identity, shared norms, and close personal relationships, while Gesellschaft is characterized by impersonal relations, formal organization, and the absence of common, binding norms.</p>
<p>Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft are two German words that mean community and society, respectively. The German sociologist Ferdinand Tönnies systematically expounded these as the ideal types of social organizations in his prominent work Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft (1887). <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://pediaa.com/what-is-the-difference-between-gemeinschaft-and-gesellschaft/">Source</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
