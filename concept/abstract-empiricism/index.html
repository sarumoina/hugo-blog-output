<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Abstracted empiricism refers to a style of quantitative sociology that attempts to explain the interrelationship between sociological variables using multivariate analysis. The term ‘abstracted empiricism’ was probably coined by C. Wright Mills (1960) to distinguish an approach to sociology that he regarded as obsessed with method and detrimental to the sociological imagination.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Multivariate analysis</strong> is a statistical technique that attempts to show how more than two operationalised concepts are interrelated. Multivariate analysis (MVA) uses statistical measures of association, including correlation and regression techniques where appropriate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Abstracted empiricism is another term for the approach to quantitative social research exemplified by the Columbia School of Sociology, including the work of Paul Lazarsfeld.</p>
<ul>
<li>Crossman (2016) stated: <em>Abstracted empiricism is the practice of gathering sociological data for one’s own sake without developing a theoretical framework that would give that data meaning and value. This is a term coined by C. Wright Mills, who was concerned that sociology would become saturated in information but lacking ideas, especially with the dawn of high-speed computers.</em></li>
