<h4 id="the-comparative-method">The Comparative Method</h4>
<p>The comparative method refers to <em>&ldquo;the method of comparing different societies or groups within the same society to show whether and why they are similar or different in certain respects.&rdquo;</em> By comparing of differences across societies or groups within the same society, one can find clues in order to understand the societies in a better manner. This method isn&rsquo;t exclusive only to sociology rather it is an universal one since it is based upon reasoning. There are various Sociologists who has used this method in their work and thus made it popular in the 19<!-- raw HTML omitted -->th<!-- raw HTML omitted --> century. For example,</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.endr.in/people/emile-durkheim/"><strong>Durkeheim</strong></a>: He has explained the comparative method on three different occasions which are as follows:<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>In his &ldquo;The Rules of Sociological Method&rdquo;, he opined that the sociological explanation consists entirly in the establishment of casual connections. It is different from establishing casual connections in natural sciences since in the case of natural science, the casual connections could be more easily established due to facility of experiment while that is not applicable in social science. Since such direct methods are not applicable, one has to resort to indirect methods such as comparative method.</li>
<li>In his work, &ldquo;Division of Labor in Society&rdquo;, he compared the legal systems of different societies at the same time and their different levels of devlopment. He proposed the hypothesis that <strong>increase in the division of labor is accompanied by a change in social integration.</strong></li>
<li>Further, in his study, &ldquo;Suicide&rdquo;, he showed that the suicide rate varied inversely with the degree of social cohesion and with the degree of stability of moral norms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, by employing this method, it may be possible to explain the siginificance of a custom or practice, though it varies from one society to another, by studying the motives behind it. For example, this method can be used in orer to explain correlations between crime and urbanisation, between family size and social mobility etc.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Critics have pointed out that, what appearsupericially to be similar institutions may, in fact, be very different in the societies being considered. There are practical difficulties that one needs to face while employing this method. Even though there are limitations of the comparative method, due to the absnece of any experimental method this does serve the purpose.</p>
<h4 id="the-historical-method">The Historical Method</h4>
<p>It refers to the study of events, processes and institutions of past civilizations for the purpose of finding the origins or antecendents (a person&rsquo;s ancestors or family and social background) of contemporary social life and thus understanding its nature and working. It is based on the idea that our present forms of social life, traditions, cultures, beliefs, values have their roots in the past and hence, one can explain them in a deeper manner when they are traced back to the origin. This method could be regarded as the base upon which historical sociology was born.</p>
<p>The historical apporach has two main forms.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first one is influenced by biological theory of evolution: It was mainly followed by <a href="https://blog.endr.in/people/auguste-comte/">Comte</a>, <a href="https://blog.endr.in/people/herbert-spencer/">Spencer</a> and <a href="https://blog.endr.in/people/leonard-trelawny-hobhouse/">Hobhouse</a>.</li>
<li>By economic interpretation:</li>
