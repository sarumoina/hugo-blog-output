<h4 id="opinions-from-various-scholars">Opinions from various scholars:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Zygmunt Bauman</strong>: power as the key driver of social relationships. Power refers to status and role and society based upon values created and maintained by those who have power and the resources to propagate the values. The power hierarchies will define the meanings acquired by objects and things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>C. W. Mills</strong>: (Limited to American Society). He shows how values and history shape our views. Each society has its own way of thinking as collective but it can also change under impact of sudden social changes. What people imagine to be or themselves as its members, is shaped through a long historical process that creates certain kinds of values and then those values gets embedded in the system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, <strong>Bauman</strong> emphasizes role played by power while <strong>Mills</strong> look towards a historical shaping of cognition.</p>
<h4 id="sociological-methods">Sociological methods:</h4>
<p>Mills (1959) concept of “<strong>abstracted empiricism</strong><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>” posits that <strong>empirical studies</strong><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> mostly follow a set pattern of collecting data with conventional styles of collecting them, which then are codified<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Limitation of this process:</strong></p>
<p>most studies involving the collection and analysis of public opinion, look into the aspect of how public opinion are mapped and collected as data, but <strong>they ignore the process of getting the data or the process by which public opinion is formed.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mills</strong> work may hold true only for US and western countries. What is important is that in the abstracted empirical style, what is needed to be studied has not been given consideration, and the emphasis has been on method rather than content of study and also its relevance for being studied.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://blog.endr.in/concept/abstract-empiricism/"><strong>Abstracted empiricist</strong></a> is more concerned with the philosophy of science, the Scientific Method, rather than what he studies is all about.</p>
<p><strong>Paul F. Lazersfeld</strong> has explained how abstracted empiricism can be used as a style of work and regards the “<strong>sociologist as the methodologist of all social sciences</strong>”. Thus empiricism becomes the hallmark of sociology as compared to philosophy or epistemology. Rather than thinking about why things happen, sociologists try to focus on what is happening and how it is happening.</p>
<p><em>Mills opposition to abstracted empiricism was based on its preoccupation with method and its consequent lack of substantive propositions and theories. Abstracted empiricists, according to Mills, project themselves as scientists, and their approach as akin to the scientific procedures of natural science. This lead to the fetishism of method, an obsession with ‘reliability’, and more concern with the philosophy of science than with the social research study itself.</em> <a href="https://www.qualityresearchinternational.com/socialresearch/abstractedempiricism.htm">source: qualityresearchinternational</a></p>
<h4 id="sociology-in-everyday-life">Sociology in everyday life:</h4>
<p>Mills’ (1959) concept of “<a href="/study/reference/the-promise-mills"><strong>The Promise</strong></a>” relates to the <strong>trap</strong> that people find themselves unable to get rid-off life circumstances. People are caught in the vicious circle of mundane ordinary everyday living which are affected by circumstances beyond their control but which they fail to comprehend.</p>
<p>To illustrate Mills’s viewpoint, let’s use our sociological imaginations to understand some important contemporary social problems. We will start with unemployment, which Mills himself discussed. If only a few people were unemployed, Mills wrote, we could reasonably explain their unemployment by saying they were lazy, lacked good work habits, and so forth. If so, their unemployment would be their own personal trouble. But when millions of people are out of work, unemployment is best understood as a public issue because, as Mills (1959, p. 9)Mills, C. W. (1959). The sociological imagination. London, England: Oxford University Press. put it, “the very structure of opportunities has collapsed. Both the correct statement of the problem and the range of possible solutions require us to consider the economic and political institutions of the society, and not merely the personal situation and character of a scatter of individuals.” <a href="/study/reference/the-promise-mills"><strong>explained in detail here</strong></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Trap</strong>: is referring to the social changes that occur which affect the ordinary man — certain external influences which transcend the internal human spaces, and both are inter-related. But people are unable to decipher that happenings in the world outside have a direct effect on the everyday and make them what they are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus human agency is limited by where we are born and what happens outside of our immediate social context. Thus the sociological imagination is constructed out of historical circumstances and values that are received. When people come in touch with other societies their ability or willingness is conditioned by information received and not actual circumstances. <strong>Thus reason is often overridden by values in the sociology of everyday life.</strong></p>
<h4 id="comparative-method">Comparative method:</h4>
<p>The comparative method is where the researcher collects data about different social groups (eg working-class; middle-class and upper-class) and then compares one group with another to identify what is evident in one group but not another. <a href="https://sociologytwynham.com/2015/01/05/the-comparative-method/">source: sociologytwynham.com</a></p>
<p>The <em>analyst</em> can see the link between <strong>history</strong> and the <strong>individual</strong>. They enable the individual to understand his/her experiences in that particular period and calculate their chances in life by looking at other individual in similar circumstances. The special ability of the sociologists is to connect the personal to the larger context both historically and in the present circumstances.</p>
<h4 id="sociological-concepts">Sociological Concepts:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Group:</strong> Individuals can not function as an isolated system as they are born in one and it is is the group that gives identity/meaning of existence to that person. But on the downside, groups often restrains an individual on some other aspects. Hence, social groups can act both as enabler and constrainer at the same time. It is social knowledge that we gathered from the group ultimately contributes to the forming of values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Socialization:</strong> The group socializes the self so as to be capable of living in society. There are two types of <em>Socialization</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Primary Socialization:</strong> It enables the individual to develop the self&rsquo;s intentions and expectations.</li>
<li><strong>Seondary Socialization:</strong> Pattial shift from what the individual used to be to adapt to the changes in the surrounding environment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In-Group &amp; Out- Group:</strong> As we grow in life, with some people, the bond becomes stronger over time and hence, we grow closer while with some other persons, we just maintian nothing but a functional relationship. From this concept, the in-group and out-group concepts do arise.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In-Group:</strong> e.g. family, friendship etc.</li>
<li><strong>Outgroup</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stranger:</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Together and apart:</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="sociology-and-other-disciplines">Sociology and other disciplines:</h4>
<p><strong>Mills: Types of Practicality and the Bureaucratic Ethos</strong> Mills has time and time implied that, the increasing <em>illiberalism</em> of society has instead of reforming the society in 19yj dentury, now it tries to serve a managerial elite who maintains the society further to exploit it even more. Today, Social science is ureaucratic: it serves the goals of bureaucracy at the same time that it is done within its own bureaucratic setting.</p>
<p>Mills breaks down this “bureaucratic development” in sociology into five main features</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Standardization of social inquiry: he methods sociologists are using are increasingly identical to each other</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>research institutions systematized: research institutions have become systematized as well, with workflows that can carry out the work of polling that sociologists now do. Instead of cultivating scholars, universities become training centers that produce pollsters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change in mental habits: scholars themselves change their mental habits. Instead of thinking about social structure, they think about the specific task at hand, and original and creative thought is diminished.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>studies now serve bureaucratic means: Instead of social science providing the public with information, it now caters to “clients,” usually administrators who want to make their institutions more efficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>social science increases social domination: by giving bureaucracy these tools, the managerial elite are empowered to control society more effectively.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, What all this means is that social science comes into line with the dominant social structure. Instead of critiquing or even describing the current state of affairs, social science perpetuates it. In turn, social science can’t be counted on to help society transform. It can’t even be counted on to give the public (as opposed to private clients) useful information. Social science is no longer autonomous, and therefore it can’t help the public reform society. It serves domination, rather than disrupting it.</p>

<p><strong>Mills: Types of Practicality and the Bureaucratic Ethos</strong> (From IGNOU textbook)</p>
<p>Mills has crticizied the approach towards sociology in many different ways. The problem begins with objectivity and perspective. If the scholar has a biased opinion, then all the research that he will conduct, will also be result of a biased persepctive. There is also a case of different results getting yielded by taking different approaches even without natural bias towards values.</p>
<p>To understand the deeper elements of social issues, one should study it without involving any <em>conflicting values</em> which is impossible to achieve since one way or the other, people tend to be biased towards certain area of the spectrum whether conciously or sub conciously.</p>
<p>As Hume famously remarked that “we cannot deduce how we ought to act from what we believe is” and nor “can we deduce how anyone else ought to act from how we believe we ought to act”. <em>Openness to accepting a multitude of opinions may also be seen as an aspect of the sociological mode of thinking.</em></p>
<p>These days’ studies are mostly undertaken to please the power holders and those who control the resources for the conduct of research—military, social workers, big corporations and the prison, and the market for such research is also increasing. There is also research done for ideological reasons, such as to prove or disprove a particular political standpoint, feminism or environmentalism for example.</p>
<p>The political meanings and administrative uses of social sciences have seen a shift and have been overshadowed by new manipulative methods that can be termed as bureaucratic social science. Such research work may involve funds being provided and facilities made available only to prove something that privileges the funding institution or agency. Applied sociologist are concerned about only what specific clients want to know — a shift from public to specific. Institutions with power can train sociologists with the tools and techniques to do research without the philosophical grounding that mkes for ethical and moral evaluation.</p>
<p>The issue here is that social science should be a ‘publicly responsible enterprise’ for there ages all chances of it being expropriated. There are chances that researchers lose their individuality while working in a bureaucratic setup. The control that the bureaucracy has on the values and ideas of precisely anything that can be thought of is also contributive to a control of history. The use of language is also curtailed and prescribed. The bureaucratic control over sociological research is thus counter-productive of intellectual growth as well as against social justice.</p>
<p><strong>Mills: Uses of History:</strong></p>
<p>In case of sociological subject invovled with history, the fact checking of historical facts are of utmost importance. Adding to the complexity, researchers in different societies might be influenced by different factors which may change their perspective to look at things. For example, a sociologist scholar in India might be interested more about caste system even though he might have his personal own biaseness. Hence, if we need to assume that historical facts can be distorted, we won&rsquo;t be wrong completely as it probably happens more often.</p>
<h4 id="sociology-and-reality">Sociology and reality:</h4>
<p><strong>Mills: The human variety</strong></p>
<p>Since there are different social system with different structure and complexity, while comparing them, one has to keep in mind that there should be an approached with unbiased nature as anything other than unbiased perspective will result in distorted results.</p>

<p>In philosophy, empiricism is a theory that states that knowledge comes only or primarily from sensory experience. In other words, the theory that all knowledge is based on experience derived from the senses.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>It is a way of gaining knowledge by means of direct and indirect observation or experience. Empirical evidence (the record of one&rsquo;s direct observations or experiences) can be analyzed quantitatively or qualitatively. Quantifying the evidence or making sense of it in qualitative form, a researcher can answer empirical questions, which should be clearly defined and answerable with the evidence collected (usually called data).&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
