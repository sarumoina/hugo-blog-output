</ul>
<p>Sociology and social anthropology, though have come from different roots, both the subjects are very much interrelated as discipline. As academic discipline, both have emerged only in 19th century though without any demarcation, both the discipline existed in early centuries also.</p>
<h4 id="emergence-of-sociology">Emergence of Sociology</h4>
<p>he emergence of sociology could be attributed to changes that occurred in the western world during the 18<!-- raw HTML omitted -->th<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and 19<!-- raw HTML omitted -->th<!-- raw HTML omitted --> century where new scientific discovery and methodology has enabled the people to systematize and structure the physical in a more orderly manner which has led to requirement of realization of society as an entity and the role of individuals in the system. As science began to advance more rapidly, different approaches are started to appear in order to use these methods in the subject of human society which was pioneered by researchers such as Come, Durkheim etc.</p>
<p>The industrial revolution has changed society from small scale home based production to large scale industry based which has influenced the society not only in terms of economy but it brought changes in to the political world, the dogma of the society as a whole and it was a shift from an old world society to the modern one which as we know of now.</p>
<p>But these changes had both positive and negative aspects along with it. Since, it was the time when science was the driving force, it took people away from the dark ages and tried to teach people to think in a more logical manner. But as it was still in the early stat of the changes, it was chaotic/unorganized. None the less, due to these changes that have occurred in the 18th-19th century, Sociology as a distinct discipline came to existence.</p>
<h4 id="the-enlighten-periodage-of-reasons">The Enlighten period/Age of Reasons</h4>
<p>During the 18th century, due to advancement of science, there brought changes of how people think which has paved the path for the enlighten period or the age of reasons. The existing beliefs were replaces by new ones which were based upon logic and reasons. Most prominent thinkers in this period are –</p>
<ul>
<li>Charles Montesquieu</li>
<li>Jean Jacques Rousseau</li>
</ul>
<p>This period shifted the society from values that were deemed to integrate to be tempered with and brought a new world of different values. Individuals started to believe in more rational and logical thoughts. As the wave of rational thoughts came in to play, nothing has become infallible and every entity became susceptible to criticism according to the new standard that this era has brought. Thus human started to realize their infinite potential which was later translated in to industrial revolution which marked a significant millstone in human history.</p>
<h4 id="the-scientific-revolution">The Scientific revolution</h4>
<p>The Scientific revolution is marked by <em>a new attitude towards man and nature</em>. During this time, people started to look at natural objects in a more observed manner and started various experimentation in order to understand various phenomenon in a better way. For example, Copernican revolution has lead to shift from <em>geocentric</em> model where the field of astronomy centered around earth into <em>heliocentric</em> model where Sun takes the center place. The discovery of gravitational force by Isac Newton was another milestone that was achieved during this era which has brought another dimension in the world of physics. Though, it was Darwins <em>theory of evolution</em> which has challenged the age old belief of biblical theory of genesis. During this era, people started to question the old idologies and started to use reason/logic in order to understand their surrounding whether it was an animate or inanimate entitiy.</p>
<p>This has also lead to urgency of using scientifc method in order to understand the human society. Hence, though it wasn&rsquo;t regarded as acedmic discpline at that time, sociology already came in to existence.</p>
<h4 id="french-revolution">French Revolution</h4>
<p>The French Revolution (1789) has brought the concepts of</p>
<ul>
<li>liberty</li>
<li>fraternity</li>
<li>equality</li>
</ul>
<p>Though this revolution is called french revolution due to its origin, its influence was not only limited to france or even europe but even distant countries were also influenced by the elements that french revolution has brought to the table.</p>
<p>During the period of enlightment, like any other nation, France had also entered into a phase where the thoughts of the people were changing and people started to believe that, anything can be explained by logic and reasons.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some of these thinkers were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Montesquieu (1689-1755)</li>
<li>Locke(1632-1704)</li>
<li>Voltaire(1694-1778)</li>
<li>Rousseau (1712-1778)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The changes that were occuring in the age of enlightment led the society to go against the age old system of monarchy/feudalism and bring political changes based upon equality and hence liberal democracy was also implemented after the revolution.</p>
<p>Though, the revolution brought multiple positive aspects, all the people did not agree with the circumstances that it did create. During the revolution, there was chaos, anarchy and a sense of unstability prevailing in the surrounding and many writers voiced aginst this unstability in the society. Some of them wanted the society to return back where it was once as it was more peaceful. But soon others have realized that, the changes that already occured in the society has also changed the way how people think and hence it will be impossible to return to the previous state.</p>
<p>Hence, they tried to find new bases based upon the new ideas that has been brought by revolution in order to build a new world. Among these thinkers, the classical sociologist also made lots of contributions such as :</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.endr.in/people/auguste-comte/">Comte</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.endr.in/people/emile-durkheim/">Durkheim</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.endr.in/people/talcott-parsons/">Parsons</a></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="industrial-revolution">Industrial revolution</h4>
<p>The industrial revolution refers to not a single event rather it is a set of chained events that have propelled various western societies to move from agrarian society to a industrial one which not only left its impact on the field of production rather, the effects could be seen in all facets of life including that of political, social, economical etc. The industrial revolution began around the year <strong>1760 A.D.</strong> in England after which, over passing of time, it spread across the whole Europe. During this revolution, new tools and techniques were invented which could produce goods on a large scale. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>Spinning Jenny invented in 1767 by James Hargreaves</li>
<li>Arkwright&rsquo;s waterfame in 1769 by Arkwright</li>
</ul>
<p>All these inventions brought the age old micro production environment in to a macro industrial production which also brought changes to social life, financial stability along with urbanization of the people. Hence, the <strong>feudal system</strong> has started to get replaced by <strong>capitalists system</strong></p>
<h5 id="impact-of-industrial-revolution-on-society">Impact of industrial revolution on society</h5>
<p>There are various impacts of industrial revolution that can be seen in every aspect of a society. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Establishment of financial institutions:</strong> The system of capitalism grew more and more complex as a result of impact of industrial revolution. Banks, Insurance Companies, various finance corporations started to appear as the system required new means of elements in order to propagate and sustain the development.</li>
<li><strong>New classes in the society:</strong> With establishement of new banks and industries taking place, it is evident that new classes in the society will also appear such as industrial workers, managers, capitalists etc. Many of them filled the role while the society was transitioning from the old system in to a new one.</li>
<li><strong>Rise of population/Urbanization:</strong> With increase in production, the population also started to increase. People from rural areas moved to the towns/cities in search of jobs in those industries. New cities started to grow since more and more industries are built.</li>
<li><strong>Concerns from conservative and radical thinkers:</strong> The conservatives feared that these changes brought upon by the industrial revolution would bring chaos and disorder.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-emergence-of-sociological-thory">The emergence of sociological thory:</h4>
<p>The precursors that lead to formulation of sociological theories occured in mainly two stages.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Philosophy of history</strong> was the intial precurosr which helped in shaping up the sociological theories. People started to accept that, a society progress in certain stages or patterns and since, such patterns exist in terms of evolution of a scoeity, one can too study sociology in the scientific manner and various laws regarding society can be formulated.</li>
<li><strong>The emergence of quantitative method of social survey</strong> The implementation of social surveys has lead to recognizing the problems on society based upon multiple factors and thus formulated a way in which, a quantitative study can be made even in case of society. Thus, both these two helped in realizing the fact that society as an entity can be studied in a manner which is governed by laws, theories, postulates etc.</li>
