      <description>A German philosopher and sociologist, Georg Simmel (1858-1918) is frequently cited as one of the founders of sociology. His work is at times impressionistic, covering a wide range of issues and ideas. His most consistent and rigorous development of a sociology is known as formal sociology. In it he studies the forms that govern diverse social relationships (such as triadic and dyadic relationships, or relationships of superordination and subordination). The study of forms extends to the examination of various types or roles under which humans are labelled and organise their actions (such as the stranger, the adventurer, the miser, the prostitute) and looks at diverse phenomena of contemporary social life, including fashion (Simmel 1957), the city (Simmel 1950b) and sexuality (Oakes 1984).</description>

      <description>Ferdinand Tönnies (1855-1936) was a German sociologist. He was a major contributor to sociological theory and field studies. His distinction between two types of social groups - Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft - is what Tönnies is best known for. He was, however, a prolific writer and also co-founder of the German Society for Sociology.
Tönnies distinguished between two types of social groupings. Gemeinschaft often translated as community refers to groupings based on a feeling of togetherness.</description>

      <description>Nobleman of the ancien regime, real estate speculator, &amp;ldquo;utopian&amp;rdquo; socialist and theorizer of the bureaucratic state &amp;ndash; all of these descriptors can apply to Claude Henri de Rouvroy de Saint-Simon. In many ways a fitting embodiment of the spirit of the Super-Enlightenment collection, his thought and life bridge temporally, spiritually and intellectually the 18th and 19th centuries. In the span of his career he moved from active support of the anti-clerical French Revolution of 1789, to vociferous criticism of the resurgent Restoration Church to advocacy of his own renewal of Christianity in Nouveau Christianisme (1825).</description>

      <description>Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679), whose current reputation rests largely on his political philosophy, was a thinker with wide-ranging interests. In philosophy, he defended a range of materialist, nominalist, and empiricist views against Cartesian and Aristotelian alternatives. In physics, his work was influential on Leibniz, and led him into disputes with Boyle and the experimentalists of the early Royal Society. In history, he translated Thucydides’ History of the Peloponnesian War into English, and later wrote his own history of the Long Parliament.</description>

      <description>He used to question the social theories most frequently advocated in England in his time, he rejected the idea of laissez-faire, because he believed that a certain degree of universal cooperation is necessary to the fulfillment of the potentialities of individual men. At the same time, he disapproved of Fabian socialism because it fostered a kind of cooperation that might lead to a mere bureaucracy, hindering progress.

      <description>Introduction British philosopher and sociologist, Herbert Spencer was a major figure in the intellectual life of the Victorian era. He was one of the principal proponents of evolutionary theory in the mid nineteenth century, and his reputation at the time rivaled that of Charles Darwin. Spencer was initially best known for developing and applying evolutionary theory to philosophy, psychology and the study of society — what he called his “synthetic philosophy” (see his A System of Synthetic Philosophy, 1862-93).</description>

Works
  Positive Philosophy (1839)
  His definition of Sociology is: subject to natural and invariable laws, the discovery of which is the object of investigation.
  He gave most importance towards the scientific method.
  Comte offered an account of social evolution, proposing that society undergoes three phases in its quest for the truth according to a general law of three stages.</description>

      <guid>https://hugo-blog.endr.in/references/concept/abstract-empiricism/</guid>
      <description>Definition: Abstracted empiricism refers to a style of quantitative sociology that attempts to explain the interrelationship between sociological variables using multivariate analysis. The term ‘abstracted empiricism’ was probably coined by C. Wright Mills (1960) to distinguish an approach to sociology that he regarded as obsessed with method and detrimental to the sociological imagination.
 Multivariate analysis is a statistical technique that attempts to show how more than two operationalised concepts are interrelated.</description>
