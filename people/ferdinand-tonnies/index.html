<p><strong>Ferdinand Tönnies (1855-1936)</strong> was a German sociologist. He was a major contributor to sociological theory and field studies. His distinction between two types of social groups - <a href="https://blog.endr.in/concept/gemeinschaft-and-gesellschaft/#the-personal-and-moral-nature-of-social-ties-within-a-gemeinschaft"><strong>Gemeinschaft</strong></a> and <a href="https://blog.endr.in/concept/gemeinschaft-and-gesellschaft/#the-rational-and-efficient-nature-of-social-ties-within-a-gesellschaft"><strong>Gesellschaft</strong></a> - is what Tönnies is best known for. He was, however, a prolific writer and also co-founder of the German Society for Sociology.</p>
<p>Tönnies distinguished between two types of social groupings. <em>Gemeinschaft</em> often translated as community refers to groupings based on a feeling of togetherness. <em>Gesellschaft</em> often translated as society on the other hand, refers to groups that are sustained by an instrumental goal. <em>Gemeinschaft</em> may by exemplified by a family or a neighbourhood; <em>Gesellschaft</em> by a joint-stock company or a state.</p>
<p>His distinction between social groupings is based on the assumption that there are only two basic forms of an actor&rsquo;s will, to approve of other men. Following his &ldquo;essential will&rdquo; (&ldquo;Wesenwille&rdquo;), an actor will see himself as a means to serve the goals of social grouping; very often it is an underlying, subconscious force. Groupings formed around an essential will are called a <em>Gemeinschaft</em>. The other will is the &ldquo;arbitrary will&rdquo; (&ldquo;Kürwille&rdquo;): An actor sees a social grouping as a means to further his individual goals; so it is purposive and future-oriented. Groupings around the latter are called <em>Gesellschaft</em>. Whereas the membership in a <em>Gemeinschaft</em> is self-fulfilling, a Gesellschaft is instrumental for its members. In pure sociology theoretically these two normal types of will are to be strictly separated; in applied sociology empirically they are always mixed.</p>
