<p>He is regarded as the <strong>Father of Sociology.</strong> He considers sociology as a science based on systematic observation and classification of the social phenomenon.</p>
<p><strong>Works</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Positive Philosophy (1839)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>His definition of Sociology is: <em>subject to natural and invariable laws, the discovery of which is the object of investigation.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He gave most importance towards the scientific method.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Comte offered an account of social evolution, proposing that society undergoes three phases in its quest for the truth according to a general law of three stages. These stages are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the theological state</li>
<li>the metahpysical state</li>
<li>the positive stage</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Theological</strong> stage was seen from the perspective of 19th century France as preceding the Age of Enlightenment, in which man&rsquo;s place in society and society&rsquo;s restrictions upon man were referenced to God. Man blindly believed in whatever he was taught by his ancestors. He believed in supernatural power. Fetishism played a significant role during this time.</p>
<p><strong>By the &ldquo;Metaphysical&rdquo; stage</strong>, Comte referred not to the Metaphysics of Aristotle or other ancient Greek philosophers. Rather, the idea was rooted in the problems of French society subsequent to the French Revolution of 1789. This Metaphysical stage involved the justification of universal rights as being on a vaunted higher plane than the authority of any human ruler to countermand, although said rights were not referenced to the sacred beyond mere metaphor. This stage is known as the stage of the investigation, because people started reasoning and questioning, although no solid evidence was laid. The stage of the investigation was the beginning of a world that questioned authority and religion.</p>
<p><strong>In the Scientific stage</strong>, which came into being after the failure of the revolution and of Napoleon, people could find solutions to social problems and bring them into force despite the proclamations of human rights or prophecy of the will of God. Science started to answer questions in full stretch. In this regard, he was similar to Karl Marx and Jeremy Bentham. For its time, this idea of a Scientific stage was considered up-to-date, although, from a later standpoint, it is too derivative of classical physics and academic history.</p>
<p>Comte&rsquo;s law of three stages was one of the first theories of <strong>social evolutionism</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_Comte">source: wikipedia</a></p>
<p><strong>Comte proposed sociology to be studied in two parts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>the social statics : deals with major institutions of society such as family, economy or polity. (<em>currently social statics are called as &ldquo;social structure and function&rdquo;</em>)</li>
<li>the social dynamics : focusess on whole societies as a unit of analysis and revelad how they have developed and changed through the course of time. (<em>currently social dynamics are called as &ldquo;social change and progress&rdquo;</em>)</li>
</ul>
